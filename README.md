# Stock Market Prediction using Big Data Technologies

## Project Overview
An end-to-end Big Data pipeline for predicting stock price movements using:
- **Google Cloud Dataproc** (Managed Spark/Hadoop)
- **PySpark MLlib** for machine learning
- **Hive** for SQL-based analytics
- **HDFS** for distributed storage

## Key Features
- Processes high-frequency stock data at scale
- Compares Spark vs. Hive for different workloads
- Implements Random Forest regression for price prediction
- Cloud-native deployment on GCP
- Cost optimization using spot instances
